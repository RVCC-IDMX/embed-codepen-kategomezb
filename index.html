          <h2>Hello, I'm Katerine!</h2>
          <p>I was born in Bogota, Colombia. As the second youngest of 4 children, my daily activities included soccer and video games. I belive that being in this country made me appreciate everything I have in my home country. Aside from the outdoor activities and the video games, I also find an interest in photography. In my free time I like to take pictures so I can play with them on photoshop. I like photography because there are many ways of saying things, but photographs are the only objective medium that exists, capable of providing all perspectives from a single plane. It is wonderful what is learned and what can then be transmitted.</p>
